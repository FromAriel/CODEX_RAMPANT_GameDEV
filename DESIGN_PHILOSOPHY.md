# Design Philosophy

This project aims for small, modular components that can be recombined easily. Scripts live under `src/` and use `class_name` for referencing. Scenes are lightweight and rely on placeholders instead of final art. Keep logic separated from presentation. Prefer simple solutions over clever ones.
